To prepare for the tutorial, make sure you install Textual in your preferred way.
Here are the commands to install Textual in a virtual environment:

```bash
~:$ python -m venv .venv  # Create & activate virtual environment.
~:$ . .venv/bin/activate
~:$ python -m pip install textual
~:$ python -m textual  # Open the Textual demo app.
~:$ python -m pip install textual-dev  # Utilities we'll use later in the tutorial
~:$ textual --version
```

The command `python -m textual` ensures Textual was correctly installed and the command `textual --version` ensures that `textual-dev` was correctly installed.
